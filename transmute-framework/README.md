# Transmute Framework Tutorial

The transmute framework helps you build dapps that leverage ethereum and ipfs with truffle.

## Testing Transmute Contracts via Truffle

See the tutorials on ganache and ipfs.

[Ganache](../ganache-cli/README.md)
[IPFS](../ipfs/README.md)

For convenience, we provide a docker-compose file here, that helps spin up these services. You can also run them locally on your computer, via docker, minikube or remotely.

```
docker-compose up
```

```
npm i -g truffle
npm i
truffle test
```
